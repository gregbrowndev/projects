# Note - a final step in Dockerising the Angular client app is to ensure the app is served from the host created
# by the docker image. To do this go into package.json and change 'start' under 'scripts' to
# '"start": "ng serve -H 0.0.0.0"'. This will run using the built in server, analogous to Django's runserver
# In production this app would be deployed using a proper server, such as Express.
