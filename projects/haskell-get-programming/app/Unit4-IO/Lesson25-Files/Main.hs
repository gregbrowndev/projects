{- Lesson 25: Working with Files

After this lesson, I'll be able to:
  - Use the ByteString type to efficiently work with binary data`
  - Treat ByteString as reguler ASCII strings by using ByteString.Char8
  - Glitch JPEG images by using Haskell
  - Work with binary Unicode data

In this lesson, we'll write a program to create glitch art. This is where
we deliberately corrupt binary data of an image to introduce visual
artifacts.
